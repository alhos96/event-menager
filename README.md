# Event Manager
The centralized event management system enables platform users to post different kinds of events and also enable interested attendees to register online for these events.

## starting and using the application

#### backend

In terminal type command `cd server` and add your own .env file with following variables: **PORT** use 5000,  **MONGO_URI** use "mongodb+srv://**username**:**password**@pizzaordercomposer.n9nav.mongodb.net/**project_number**?retryWrites=true&w=majority" and **JWT_SECRET** . After that run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. After completing these steps run `npm start` script. 

That runs the server part of application in the development mode on http://localhost:5000.

#### frontend

After cloning repository and opening it in terminal type command `cd client` and run `npm install` script to install all the dependencies. After successfull instalataion run `npm start`. 

That runs the frontend part of application in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Register new user and login with those credentials. At the same time, in another tab navigate to **localhost:3000** again and register one more user and use credentials to login.
